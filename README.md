# SimplOxide

SimpleX-Chat WebSocket client and bot SDK in Rust.

### Quickstart

- ðŸ¤–[Try out](./simploxide-client) example bots
- ðŸ’¡[See crate docs](https://docs.rs/simploxide-client/latest/simploxide_client/) for
  guidance on how to make one.

### About

Right now you're supposed to use the
[simploxide-client](https://crates.io/crates/simploxide-client) crate because
the bot SDK doesn't exist yet. You can implement everything you want with the
[simploxide-client](https://crates.io/crates/simploxide-client) with the only
downside that you won't have the convenient interfaces and helper methods that
cover common bot development tasks. The [simploxide-client](https://crates.io/crates/simploxide-client)
crate provides a native Rust support for everything described
[in SimpleX API docs](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/tree/stable/bots)

The other crates are:

- [simploxide-core](https://crates.io/crates/simploxide-core): A fully
  asynchronous raw SimpleX Chat client with strong graceful shutdown
  guarantees. The `simploxide-client` simply provides a higher-level typed API
  on top of this implementation. Use this crate instead of the
  `simploxide-client` if you want to work with raw SimpleX commands and JSON
  responses and significally improve compile times by doing so.

- [simploxide-api-types](./simploxide-api-types): Autogenerated from [SimpleX
  API docs](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/tree/stable/bots) Rust
  types and traits with serialization, command syntax interpretation, and even
  some syntax sugar support. You may want to use this crate explicitly if
  you're implementing your own SimpleX clients in Rust.

- [simploxide-bindgen](./simploxide-bindgen): A crate that produces
  `simploxide-api-types` files and automatically keeps them up to date by
  parsing the upstream documentation and generating the code from it. You can
  use this crate as a library to generate SimpleX API bindings for other
  languages.

- [simploxide](./simploxide): An empty crate reserved for the future bot SDK
  that will provide a lot of utilities on top of `simploxide-client` to cover
  common bot development tasks.
