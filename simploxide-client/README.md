# simploxide-client

SimpleX-Chat WebSocket client

## ðŸ¤–Try out SimplOxide bots right now!

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) if you haven't already.
1. [Get SimpleX chat CLI](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/blob/stable/docs/CLI.md#%F0%9F%9A%80-installation)
1. Run SimpleX Chat CLI with the following flags to prepare the bot account:
   ```bash
   simplex-chat --create-bot-display-name 'SimplOxide Examples' --create-bot-allow-files
   ```
    1. Alternatively, you can run this command from the SimpleX CLI itself:
       ```bash
       /create bot files=on 'SimplOxide Examples'
       ```
1. Run SimpleX Chat CLI as an API server listening on port 5225(all example
   bots are connecting to this port by default):
   ```bash
   simplex-chat -p 5225
   ```
1. Run the squaring bot:
   ```
   cargo run --example squaring_bot --all-features
   ```
   You can run any bot from [examples/](./examples) directory by changing the
   `--example` argument.
    1. All example bots output their address when they start. Use this address
       to connect to your bot in SimpleX app(always prefer the shorter one):
       ![Addresses Screenshot](./screenshots/addresses.png)
