# v0.6.0 - Major changes in code generation and generated types

- Now new generated `ClientApi` methods segregate good responses from bad ones.
  `Undocumented` responses are considered to be bad by default and result in
  `ClientApiError` but `Result<T, impl ClientApiError>` implements the
  `AllowUndocumentedResponses` trait extension which allows to override this
  behavior by moving the `Undocumented` variant from `Err` to `Ok` side of the
  `Result`

- Code generation of the `ClientApi` now simplifies responses by turning
  response enums into structs where possible and implementing helper response
  getters for enums where simplification is impossible.

- Introduce a new `ClientApiError` trait which must be implemented by
  `ClientApi::Error` types. This trait is mainly needed to be able handle
  undocumented responses in different ways.

- Extended prelude includes newly genetated `client_api` types and traits.

# v0.5.0 - New type for undocumented fields

- The type of undocumented fields was changed from `HashMap<Key, Value>` to
  `BTreeMap<Key, Value>` because `BTreeMap`s can be default-constructed in
  `const` contexts enabling const definitions of requests and request parts.

# v0.4.0 - Critical API fixes and automaintenance mode

- Fixes for APIs that were barely usable due to missing trait implementations
  or unergonomic return types.

- A new script that maintains this repository by automatically generating and
  submitting new type definitions whenever SimpleX-Chat changes its API
  definitions
